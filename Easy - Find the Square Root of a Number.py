# This program is to find the Sqaure Root of a number using Python

# Get the input from the user in float format

number = float(input("Number = "))

# Apply the formula for finding the sqaure root

square_root = (number)**(1/2)

# Print the square root of the number

print(f"The square root of the given number is {square_root}")
